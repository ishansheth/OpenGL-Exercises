# OpenGL Exercises

This repository contains sample programs which demostrates the basic concepts of graphics programming using openGL. The sample programs are based on the tutorial from [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) and incorporates the usage of imgui library. The exerciese include the concepts and usage of:
  - Vertices and Vertex Arrays
  - Shader programming
  - Vertex Buffer, Index Buffer
  - Camera angles and coordinate system
  - Texture
  - Lighting (Ambient, Diffuse and Specular lighting)
  - Material map
  - Light Casting
  - Multiple lights with Directional light and point light
